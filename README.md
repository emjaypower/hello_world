# Overview

This is a basic hello world program. It was created to demonstrate the integration of the Visual Studio Code IDE, github, and python together. I created this project to enhance my skillset as a software engineer.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
